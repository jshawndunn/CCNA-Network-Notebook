# Ethernet LAN Switching Labs

Hands-on Packet Tracer labs focused on observing how Ethernet switches forward frames within a local area network (LAN).

These labs are used to explore switch behavior such as MAC address learning, flooding, and frame forwarding before introducing VLANs or routing.

The goal of these labs is to understand *what the switch does* and *why it behaves that way*, not to memorize commands.
