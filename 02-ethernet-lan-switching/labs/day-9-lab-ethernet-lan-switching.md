# Day 9 Lab – Connecting Devices

## Lab Source
Packet Tracer file provided by Jeremy’s IT Lab.
Used for hands-on practice and observation.

## Goal
Become familiar with viewing and configuring interfaces on a Cisco switch

## What I Did
- Set hostname for routers and switches
- Configure IP address router interfaces
- Configure IP addresses for end host
- Manually set speed
- Manually set duplex
- Configure description for interfaces
- Disable interfaces not used

## What I Observed
- Switch interfaces are not administratively shut down by default
- Router interfaces are administratively down by default


## What I’m Not Fully Sure About Yet
- When manual speed/duplex configuration is preferred over auto-negotiation

## Commands used
- hostname
- show ip interface brief
- show interface status (only switches)
- interface range f0/3-24, g0/2
- speed <speed>
- duplex <duplextype>
- ip address <ip subnet>
- write
