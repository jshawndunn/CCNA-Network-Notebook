# IP Addressing

Concepts related to logical addressing and how devices identify and reach networks beyond their local segment.

This section focuses on how IP addresses are structured, how subnetting works, and how devices determine whether traffic should stay within the local network or be sent to a router.

The goal is to understand how Layer 3 addressing enables communication between networks before introducing routing protocols.
