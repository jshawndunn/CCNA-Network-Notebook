# IP Address Structure

## Why this exists
IP addresses provide logical identification for devices so they can communicate within and between networks.

Unlike MAC addresses, which operate hop-to-hop, IP addresses identify both the network and the specific host within that network.

## When it breaks / goes wrong

## How I would tell

## One thing I keep forgetting

## Mental model
An IP address is like a mailing address:
- The network portion identifies the neighborhood.
- The host portion identifies the specific house.

Before sending traffic, a device determines whether the destination is on the same network or must be sent to a router.

- How to quickly determine host ranges from a prefix length
- How devices determine if a destination IP is local
