## Why this exist
The Command Line Interface (CLI) is used to interact directly with a network device

## When it breaks / goes wrong
- Being in the wrong mode prevents commands from working

## How I would tell
- Certain commands are unavailable or rejected

## One thing I keep forgetting
You must be in the correct mode to perform specific tasks.

## Mental Model
The CLI is the underlying set of commands that a graphical interface would use to perform actions.

## Notes / Open questions
Common task by mode:
- User EXEC: basic checks
- Privileged EXEC: device state
- Global Configuration: system-wide changes
