# Day 3 Lab – OSI Model

## Lab Source
Packet Tracer file provided by Jeremy’s IT Lab.
Used for hands-on practice and observation.

## Goal
Become familiar with the Simulation Panel and how events are shown across OSI layers.

## What I Did
- Observed a Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) event
- Released and renewed the IP address for PC1 and observed the DHCP event

## What I Observed
Different OSI layers are involved depending on the type of network event

## What I’m Not Fully Sure About Yet
How to interpret all of the details shown in the simulation view
