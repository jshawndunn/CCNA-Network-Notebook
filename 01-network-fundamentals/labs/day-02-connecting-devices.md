# Day 2 Lab – Connecting Devices

## Lab Source
Packet Tracer file provided by Jeremy’s IT Lab.
Used for hands-on practice and observation.

## Goal
Become familiar with network interfaces and basic cable types.

## What I Did
- Connected devices using different cable types
- Observed link status indicators
- Verified that physical connections were established

## What I Observed
- Devices did not communicate when incorrectly cabled
- Link lights indicated when a connection was active
- Cisco Router links are disabled by default causing a red link light
- Correct cable selection allowed devices to connect

## What I’m Not Fully Sure About Yet
- When crossover cables are required versus automatically handled
