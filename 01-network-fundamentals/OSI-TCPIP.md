## Why this exist
The TCP/IP model provides a way to group networking protocols into layers based on the job they perform.

## When it breaks / goes wrong
Data cannot move between layers as expected.

## How I would tell
Users do not receive the data they requested.

## One thing I keep forgetting
The TCP/IP model is a conceptual framework, not a strict implementation.

## Mental Model
How a letter is delivered. Each layer maps to a different step of the delivery.

## Notes / Open questions
How the TCP/IP model maps to the OSI model in practice.
