# Network Devices – Core Roles

## Why this exists
Different network devices exist because traffic needs to be handled in different ways.

## When it breaks / goes wrong
- A server or client doesn't receive the data it is expecting

## How I would tell
- Communication fails

## One thing I keep forgetting

## Mental model
Each device serves a specific purpose. They work together to move data through the network like an assembly line.

## Notes / Open questions

## Switch
- Has many ports for connecting devices
- Provides connectivity for host within the same LAN only.
- Does not connect different networks together

## Router
- Provide connectivity between LANS

## Firewall
- Uses rules to controls which traffic is allowed or blocked
- Can be placed inside or outside the network
