# Interfaces and Cables

## Why this exists
Devices need a way to physically connect to each other and send signals across a network.

## When it breaks / goes wrong
- Devices are physically connected but cannot communicate

## How I would tell
- Link lights are off
- No connection is established between devices

## One thing I keep forgetting
A device can have multiple interfaces, each serving a different connection.

## Mental model
An interface is a doorway. Cables are the hallways connecting those doorways.

## Notes / Open questions
When crossover cables are still required versus automatically handled.
